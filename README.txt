This is just a very simple example that demonstrates the producer-consumer model. Basically, any number of producers will generate random numbers at given intervals of time and place them on a queue, while consumers will pull from that queue and print out the number they got. Since producers and consumers are each on their own thread, the queue also needs to be protected from simultaneously being written to and read from.
